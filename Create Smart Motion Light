<arduino uno r3>
<Pir motion sensor>
<relay:to control ac circuit by dc current>
<ac generator to light up ac bulb>
..........
Like Servo, Pir & relay are centrally connected
But unlike Servo, they dont have header file.So,
we have to use pinMode to identify them not by name
as it were in case of Servo.

Connect signal line of PIR to a digital port and this is PIR pin.

  /*We will light a bulb if we sense a motion in pir.
   To do so, we are using a relay to control ac current
   by dc. So, here,relay will be a output pin which will
   trigger the bulb.*/
